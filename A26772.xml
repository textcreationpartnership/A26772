            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p n="1">I THE Original Author of this Book was the Eminent and Learned Dr. <hi>Bate,</hi> a Man who in his Station had been <hi>Phyſician</hi> to <hi>Two Kings of England,</hi> and a <hi>Protector;</hi> and of ſuch Approved Skill in his Profeſſion, that to make any Deſcants thereon, would be to draw a Vail over his Luſtre, and blemiſh that Excellency, which in this following Work, gives a convincing Proof, that he was one of the greateſt Maſters of his Art in the Univerſe.</p>
            <p n="2">II. His <hi>Arcana</hi> and <hi>Preſcripts</hi> were Collected, as they appear in the Latin Copy, by that ingenious and indefatigable Gentlemen, Mr. <hi>James Shipton,</hi> who had the Happineſs of preparing and making the greater part (if not all) of them up: And by whoſe Care and Induſtry the World became bleſt with ſuch a valuable Production; which exceeds in its Benefit and Uſefulneſs to Mankind, (we ſpeak it without Flattery) all the Diſpenſatories this day extant, in what Language ſoever.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Thus came out the firſt Edition, with general Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, which meriting ſo well in the World, Mr. <hi>Shipton</hi> was pleaſed to make us happy with a Second, wherein he added above One hundred more of Dr. <hi>Bate</hi>'s Recipes, and the <hi>Arcana Goddardiana,</hi> from the Authors <hi>Autograph,</hi> who being a Learned Man, and they no mean things, advanced very much the Value of the Book: So that in a very few Years, there were ſold of the Latin Copies to the number of (at leaſt) Six thouſand.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The Work obtaining thus exceedingly upon the Publick, as having the general Liking and Approbation of all the Learned World, more eſpecially of the Gentlemen
<pb facs="tcp:57532:5"/>of the Profeſſion: And among the number of the reſt, fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into my Hands, upon view thereof, finding it ſo vaſtly to exceed in Uſefulneſs and Learning whatever had been yet extant of that kind before; and that it was entertained among Profeſſors of Our Art (of what Quality or Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſoever) with no common Friendſhip or Reception: It made me conſider it a little farther; and to draw an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from its general Uſefulneſs and Entertainment; That if whilſt it wandred thro' the World in an unknown Tongue (as to the Vulgar) and was a Stranger, it became ſo deſirable and acceptable; how much more, if we indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g'd it, by making it a Free Denizon, or Native of our own.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Upon theſe Conſiderations, I immediately fell upon the <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> which I hope you will find done with all Faithfulneſs and Sincerity: And whereas the <hi>Arcana Godd.</hi> were for the moſt part <hi>Nominal,</hi> without exhibiting their <hi>Preparations:</hi> We have in this <hi>Engliſh Edition,</hi> added them at large, and interſperſt them for the Benefit of all the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of this kind of Learning.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. And whilſt we were doing this, that we might yet lay a farther Obligation upon the Generous Lovers of Art; we have added to this <hi>Impreſſion,</hi> the much eſteemed <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard s Drops,</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s <hi>Pouder</hi> (neither of them in any printed Work before) the former of which was one of the accounted ineſtimable Jewels of K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. The other that <hi>Fam'd <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> which for theſe twenty five Years laſt paſt has obtain'd a general Reputation, from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> to the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and in a manner thro' the whole World. You have alſo the <hi>Emplaſtrum Febrifugum,</hi> which, tho' as to its Compoſition, it is a very ſimple thing, and whilſt not publiſhed, hugg'd as a great Secret, yet truly valuable as to its Vertues, for that it has ſcarcely been ever known to be applied without the deſired Succeſs; nor did I ever uſe it in vain. And to theſe we have added near half an hundred more, of conſiderable Recipes, out of the <hi>Collectanea Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mica,</hi> and other valuable Authors.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. We have not here given you a bare Tranſlation only, but beſides that, a large Comment upon each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar (as the Nature of the Subject would admit, or did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire) more eſpecially upon all the <hi>Chymical Proceſſes,</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:57532:5"/>are many, and the moſt excellent, ſelected out of a large Farraginous heap; and made choice of from mighty Strength of Reaſon, and a long Series of Experiences, which has exceedingly added to their Credit and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. Theſe We have almoſt every where ſearcht out, from their <hi>Original Fountains,</hi> and where need required, given a <hi>clear Explication of the Proceſs</hi> it ſelf, and added as a <hi>Supplement</hi> (to make the Work the more abſolute and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat) a <hi>Rationale</hi> upon the ſame.</p>
            <p>And farther, We have examin'd the Preſcripts and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of the moſt Learned Authors who have wrote there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: Shewing, either their <hi>Proceſſes</hi> at large, <hi>if new;</hi> Or, the particular Circumſtances wherein they <hi>chiefly differ, if material;</hi> and ſo repreſenting as it were in a Glaſs, a Summary of all that has been hitherto written of this kind.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. As to the Authors made uſe of in this Book; tho' we cannot have the Vanity to obtrude a vaſt Catalogue or Heap, as is uſual with ſeveral Writers of Books (poſſibly many whom they never lookt into, to conſult, but for O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation they enumerate) yet we think it neceſſary to give an Account of the Chief of thoſe We were Beholden to, that we may put Our Artiſt into a Capacity to make a more exact and ſatisfactory Judgment of the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes.</p>
            <p n="10">X. The Chief of thoſe We conſulted in this Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king were either of the more Ancient; as, <hi>Paracelſus, Crollius, Hartman, Libavius, Beguinus, Sala, Faber, Mynſicht, Grulingius, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntzer, Quercetan, Mylius, Senner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> &amp;c. Or of the Modern and more Late; as, <hi>Riverius, Schroder, Hofman, Horſtius, Rolfincius, Marggrave, Maets, Le Mort, Ludovicus, Ettmuller, Junken, Tachenius, Glauber, Le Febure, Thibaut, Charras,</hi> and <hi>Lemery,</hi> with ſome others of leſſer Note, whoſe Performances in this kind (for ſo much as they wrote of) have been admirable above all the reſt of their Fellows.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. This being thus compleated, you may in a little time expect the Second Part of the ſame, which is now in in the Preſs, <hi>viz. Our Officina Chymica,</hi> or <hi>Chymical Shop; being a compleat Body of Chymiſtry in all in its Parts: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb facs="tcp:57532:6"/>you will find Explicated,</hi> 1. <hi>The Principles of Natural Bodies, in their received and genuine Senſe.</hi> 2. <hi>The For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces and Inſtruments of the Art particularly deſcribed with their Figures in Copper Plates.</hi> 3. <hi>The Operations of Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry</hi> per ſe, <hi>abſtracted from the Preparation of any ſet Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.</hi> 4. <hi>The Preparation of Metals and Minerals deduced from all the Operations of Chymiſtry.</hi> 5. <hi>Laſtly, The Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of certain Vegetable and Animal Subſtances, according to all the more late Diſcoveries or Deſignations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">XII. But from hence one Objection ariſes to be obviated, viz. <hi>That I have treated of many things in this Diſpenſatory, that I had handled formerly at large in my</hi> Pharmacopoeia Londinenſis <hi>and</hi> Doron, <hi>and therefore might very well have been omitted here.</hi> To which I anſwer, 1. That this is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man's Book, and my ſelf but the Tranſlator thereof; ſo that I could by no means with Juſtice and Honour have gelt the Text, or obliterated any part thereof, without a manifeſt Wrong and Injury to the Author. 2. That I have done no otherwiſe with reſpect to the aforenamed Books, than <hi>Schroder</hi> did with his <hi>Quercetanus Redivivus</hi> when he wrote his own <hi>Diſpenſatory.</hi> 3. That notwithſtanding this ſeeming Repetition, or reiterating of the very ſame thing ſometimes, you may poſſibly in this meet with that which is new concerning it, not contained in the other Books, which may recompence the Labour and Pains of a ſecond Review.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. If any of the Gentlemen of the Profeſſion, think, that in this Work or any other, we have done them Wrong or Prejudice, in diſcovering to the Vulgar, many of the <hi>Arcana</hi> of Our Art: We hope (as a Recompence for the ſame) to make them amends again, in divulging ſeveral other Secrets, which the moſt of them were wholly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of before. However as a general Anſwer to this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, We think, that all particular Intereſts ſhould ſacrifice to the general, and that the Publick good ought ever to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the Private how dear and valuable ſoever.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. It is my Opinion, that the Art of Phyſick is not any particular Man's or Societies proper Right, more than anothers; but that every Man has an equal ſhare in the ſame. But 'tis like Gold and Silver, he that wins it, or takes pains for it, ſhall have it. And as in one, every Man
<pb facs="tcp:57532:6"/>has a Right by his Wit and Induſtry, to get Gold, if he can, and having got it, to make uſe of it; ſo in the other, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man has a Right to ſtudy Phyſick if he pleaſes; and having once made himſelf Maſter of the Knowledge of it, has as great a Right to uſe it as we. Nor can I ſee ought, which may entitle any one particular Perſon to an Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Intereſt in it, more than it can another, whatever ſome ſelf-ended Men may pretend to the contrary.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. It is generous to do good to Mankind; and the more voluntary is is, the more acceptable. For my part, I owe ſo great a Friendſhip to all the World, that I wiſh every Man underſtood the Art as well as I do. And I ſhould be content upon the Condition, that it would pleaſe the moſt Good and Infinite Being, to bleſs the Sons of Men with a perpetual State of Health, to ſeek out ſome other way of living. And as Health is the moſt valuable of all Earthly Happineſſes; ſo I am of Opinion, all other Intereſts ſhould vail to it. He can be no good Man, who deſires to build up his Fortunes from the Miſeries and Calamities of others; or to raiſe an Eſtate upon the Neceſſities of the Mean, and the Ruins of ſuch as want Bread.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. For this Reaſon ſake, I have for theſe Thirty Years together exerciſed my Art (as well as to live by it) as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary piece of Charity. I know no poor Creature that ever came to me, in my whole time, that once went from me, without my deſired help <hi>Gratis.</hi> I have not only given them my Judgment or Opinion concerning their Diſeaſes and Diſtempers; but if curable and Poor) have ſupplied them with all the Medical Neceſſaries for the whole Cure, till they became perfectly well, without demanding or requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one Penny for it afterwards. And I have accounted the Reſtauration of ſuch poor and wretched Creatures a greater Bleſſing to me, than if I had gotten the Wealth of both the <hi>Indies.</hi> I can't ſo well expreſs my ſelf concerning this Matter, as I can conceive it; but I am ſure I ſhould have been more pleaſed, and had a greater Satisfaction, in ſeeing ſuch a helpleſs Creature, reſtored to its deſired Health, than if I had found a very valuable Treaſure.</p>
            <p n="17">XVII. There are ſeveral Hundreds in this Great City, can bear me witneſs to this Truth. And for all the paſt
<pb facs="tcp:57532:7"/>Good I have done in thoſe Caſes; as I can never repent it; ſo I reſolve to continue it; for I certainly know, that I have had the ſignal Bleſſing of God attended my Endeavours for it: For which, (with all humility) I here publickly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his Goodneſs; and bleſſing his moſt merciful Hand, with bended Knees give Thanks for the ſame. Nor ſhall I ever deſiſt the doing of what I have for thus many Years done in this kind, but am reſolved thro' the Aſſiſtance of the moſt good God, to exerciſe the ſame Charity, and as largely extend it, to all the Poor and Miſerable, who ſhall pleaſe to make uſe of it, whilſt I have my Senſe and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and draw Breath upon Earth.</p>
            <p n="18">XVIII. I have begun to render the Arts of <hi>Phyſick</hi> and <hi>Chyrurgery</hi> with their Appendices, the <hi>Materia Medica, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy</hi> and <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> into Engliſh; and in doing of which, by this preſent Work, and Thirteen or Fourteen other Books, I have made a conſiderable Progreſs already; and intend not to deſiſt, till I have fully made them in all their parts, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and intire. 'Tis every <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man's Birth-right, and an unſpeakable Wrong to endeavour the keeping it from him.</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. Nor do I know why any ſhould be offended with me for thus doing, ſince it is but what <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen, Celſus</hi> and <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> with hundreds more, all did, writing the <hi>Syſtem of Phyſick</hi> in their <hi>own Languages.</hi> Yea, and it is what the <hi>French</hi> (out of an Ambition of Glory) do at this day. I am ſure we are their great Admirers in moſt things, and Ape them in whatſoever is vitious and ridiculous: And why we ſhould not imitate them in a thing of ſuch an eſſential Good I know not; unleſs you would oblige us to follow them only in their Vices, and eſchew them in their Vertues.</p>
            <p n="20">XX. I know that I have many Enemies in the World, and that the publiſhing this Work will create me many more, and thoſe powerful ones, and malicious too: But I have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlookt all this, and have directed my Eye to the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of Reward. If herein I have ſerv'd my Country and Generation, I have what I aimed at, and I am ſure I ſhall have along with it the Defence of him, whoſe Mercies are over all his Works, and the Bleſſings of the Poor and Needy.</p>

This done, break the Body, take out the white Maſs and pouder it, which put into an earthen Retort half empty, place it in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberatory Furnace, luting to it a large Receiver; make a gentle Fire for the firſt three hours, to warm the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort as it were, then increaſe it every hour to the utmoſt violence, ſo will the Spirits come forth, and fill the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver with white Clouds: continue the Fire at this height for three days and nights together, then let the Veſſels cool: ſo will you have an Acid Spirit, which by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying in a Glaſs Alembick in Sand, you may make pure and clear. 3. At the bottom of the Retort is a white and very light Calx, very much rarified, which is called burnt or calcined Alum. 4. The <hi>Phlegm of Alum</hi> is uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Diſeaſes of the Eyes, for Quinſies, to cleanſe Wounds and Ulcers, and to heal them: more eſpecially if in ſix Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof, you diſſolve <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>i. of the crude Roch Alum. 5. <hi>The Acid Spirit.</hi> It is ſcarcely ſo pleaſant as that of Vitriol and Sulphur, but it is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily uſed in Juleps for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual and Continent Fevers, as alſo in Tertian Agues, and has indeed neerly all the Vertues of the Oyls, or Spirits of Vitriol or Sulphur: Doſe is from four to eight drops. It is likewiſe uſed in the cure of the <hi>Aphthae</hi> or <hi>Thruſh, i. e.</hi> little Cankers in the Mouths, for the moſt part of Children. This Spirit thus diſtilled with a ſtrong Fire for three days together, does not give place neither in ſtrength nor quantity to that of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> notwithſtanding that moſt Authors affirm the contrary, ſaying, that it yields but little Acid. 6. <hi>The white light Calx,</hi> after the laſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation, which we call <hi>burnt Alum,</hi> is uſed to eat fleſhy excreſcences, or proud fleſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but that which remained before, after the firſt diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or when the <hi>Flegm of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57532:28"/>the Alum</hi> was only drawn off, is much more Eſcarcotick than the latter, which has loſt its acid Spirits. 7. In the firſt diſtillation you muſt fill the Retort not above half full, becauſe it is apt to ſwell much, and requires a great deal of room; and the Flegm is all come off, when there di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtils no more, for the acid Spirits being very weighty, require a much greater heat than that of Sand to raiſe them. 8. Laſtly, There is no ſuch thing as an <hi>Acrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Salt of Alum,</hi> to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from its <hi>Acid Salt;</hi> for that there is nothing Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious, or purely Corroſive in this Mineral, which will not turn into an Acid Spirit, being ſtrongly forced by the Fire, which he that ſhall take the pains actually to diſtil it, ſhall find the Mechanical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of.</p>

Inwardly taken it ſtrengthens the Stomach, and is good againſt Aſthma's and other Obſtructions of the Lungs; it alſo mightily ſweetens the Blood, and is prevalent againſt Scorbutick, Arthritick, and Pocky Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms; and an excellent thing againſt the Colick. The Magiſtery has the ſame Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, but is not full out ſo powerful. 4. Outwardly it is uſed to take ſpots out of the Face, and remove the defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the skin; a dram of it being put into four oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Water, whitens it like Milk, which ſerves for a Waſh, and is called by ſome <hi>Virgins Milk.</hi> 5. This white colour in the Water, reſults from the weakning of the Tincture with the Water, whereby the Spirit quits what it held, to the Water, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of which make the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter white. 6. If this Water be ſuffered to ſtand ſtill, thoſe particles will ſettle to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, which are the Magiſtry, and the Water will become again clear. 7.

This white Spirit, or Menſtruum, (which is partly extracted from the Spirit of Vinegar, and partly from the Coral) will extract from freſh Coral put into it, a moſt red Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture; and if you make it volatile, by freeing it again from this Spirit by diſtillation, and digeſting it with Spirit of Wine, or proper Cordial Spirit, and by cohobating it, you will have an excellent Tincture of Coral, of a ſweet taſte, and fragrant ſcent. 3. That this Salt before the diſtillation of the Spirit, is to be impregnated with Spirit of Vinegar, which is gently to be diſtilled off, that the inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid Flegm may only come forth, and freſh Vinegar to be added, diſtilling in like manner again; and this courſe to be followed ſo long, till the Vinegar comes forth as ſharp as it was when it firſt went in. 4.

In this laſt Preſcript here is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, That before diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the <hi>Alcali</hi> of the Sea Salt had in a manner bound up the volatile Salt in the <hi>Sal Am.</hi> to looſen which, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlakt Lime is added whoſe <hi>Alcali</hi> deſtroys the Acid of the Sea Salt; whence it is, that as ſoon as they are mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, the volatile uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinous
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57532:41"/>Spirit begins to ariſe and diſtil; which Vapours come forth ſo plentifully, that you could never be able to put the mixture into the Retort, ſhould you not turn away your Head, while your Hands are at work. § 16. That the Water is added to moiſten it, (which <hi>Le Febure</hi> certainly forgot in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript) and to liquifie the volatile Salts; for if there were nothing to moiſten them, they would ſuddenly ſublime to the neck of the Retort, and ſtopping it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, would break it to pieces: but the quantity of the Water ſeems to be too little by half: ℥viij. of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the leaſt that ought to be uſed. § 17. By reaſon of the ſwelling of the Lime after wetting, and the great deal of room the Spirits take to rarifie themſelves in, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort muſt not be above half full, and the Receiver muſt be very large, that they may circulate with eaſe. § 18. This Spirit is nothing but a ſolution of the volatile Salt in Water: if you would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and ſeparate this Salt there from, put the Spirit into a Matraſs with its head, and a Receiver, lute the Joynts with a wet Bladder, and in Sand, with a gentle Fire, you may make the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Salt aſcend white as Snow; for it will ſublime and ſtick to the top, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt parts; which ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and keep in a Glaſs cloſe ſtopt with a Glaſs ſtopple. This Salt being dry, more eaſily flies away, than when you kept it diſſolved in the Water, for which cauſe ſake it is beſt to keep it in a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid form. § 19. This Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit made with <hi>Quick-lime</hi> is ſtronger than that made with <hi>Salt of Tartar,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe the fiery particles of the <hi>Quick-lime,</hi> quicken the motion of the volatile Salts, much more than the <hi>Salt of Tartar</hi> can do. § 20. It is alſo to be noted, That the Spirit of <hi>Sal Am.</hi> thus drawn with <hi>Quick-lime,</hi> being mixt with Spirit of Wine, will not coagulate; whereas that which is drawn with <hi>Salt of Tartar,</hi> &amp;c. will. § 21. When you take away the Receiver from the Alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick, have in readineſs a wet cloth to ſtop its mouth, that its volatile Vapours may not ſtrike your Noſtrils &amp; Brain, and ſo hinder reſpiration, and cauſe ſwooning. § 22. This volatile Spirit is alſo an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Menſtruum</hi> to make precipitations with, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys acids, as do all other volatile Alcalies, and precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates

Near as ſoon as the Water is put in, the <hi>Salt of Tartar</hi> joyns with the Acid of the Sea Salt, ſo that the Sea Salt diſingages itſelf from the Volatile Salt, thereby giving it the liberty of immediate ariſing, partly in the form of a dry Salt, and partly in the form of Spirit, ſo that you are forced as ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily as may be, to cover the Cucurbit with its Head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> § 25. From all theſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations it evidently appears, that ſhould <hi>Sal Am.</hi> be diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led alone in its own condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when expoſed to the violence of the Fire, the vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile part of the <hi>Sal Am.</hi> would do violence to the acid, and ſublime it, or carry it up with it, ſo that you would have only a mixt Flower of <hi>Sal Am.</hi> or rather <hi>Sal Am. purified,</hi> not the pure volatile alcalious Salt alone, but mixed with all its acid, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> § 26. It is alſo to be obſerved, that thô the mixture of <hi>Quick-lime,</hi> or a fit Salt, ſtops the Acid or Marine Salt from ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, letting the urinous, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile part go alone, either in dry Salt or Spirit, yet the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would be very ſlow and feeble, did you not mix Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with them, the more firmly to diſſolve the marine Salt, and the fixed Salt, and to mix them together, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their conjunction the more facile. So that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, the Spirit and volatile Salt are poſſible to be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without Water; but then it is more ſlowly, and in this caſe, beſides ſtrong luting of the Junctures, you muſt leave at leaſt three quarters of the Cucurbit empty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> § 27.

Hence it is apparent, that the <hi>Saccharum,</hi> as by diſtillation it loſes its acid particles, it receives others, which are igneous, in; more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and greater in quantity or weight, as appears by the operation: but when again it is reduced in a Crucible into <hi>Lead,</hi> the particles of the <hi>Lead</hi> coming together into a Body, expel the fiery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, ſo that the Lead revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as before, recovers but its firſt weight. § 8. The Retort ought ſcarcely to be ⅔ full, and the Receiver ought to be very large, becauſe theſe volatile Spirits flying out with violence, if they ſhould not have room enough to play in, might poſſibly break the Veſſels. § 9. <hi>Le Febure</hi> makes it after this manner: ℞ <hi>Pure Cryſtalline</hi> Saccharum Saturni <abbr>lb</abbr>

Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Fire gradatim, and the Recipient will fill with white Clouds; towards the latter end, kindle Coals round about the Retort, encreaſing the Fire to the laſt degree, to force over all the Spirits. When the Clouds diſappear, and the Recipient grows cool, put out the Fire, unlute and decant the diſtilled Spirit into a Glaſs Body, drawing off the Spirit again to drineſs: this is Spirit of Venus rectified.</hi> § 7.

Now in the diſtillation of Vipers this is to be noted, that the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver muſt be large, that the Spirits may circulate with the greater eaſe, and the Fire gentle and gradual, leaſt the too haſty ruſhing forth of the Spirit ſhould break the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. § 8.

Now to rectifie this, put all into a glaſs Retort, and diſtil firſt with a gentle Fire, ſo will a little Flegm come forth, with a ſulphurous volatile Spirit: next comes forth the acid Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, leaving the moſt ſharp Oyl, like limpid Water in the bottom. § 8.

When no more will come off, take off the Recipient, decant the Flegm, (which is uſed for Inflamations of the Eyes) and refit the Recipient again to the Retort, luting the Juncture; increaſe the Fire gradatim, and when you ſee white Clouds to fill the Receiver, continue it in the ſame condition till the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver grows cold, then ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the Fire with Wood to an extream violence, till the flame riſes through the Funnel of the Reverberatory: the Receiver will then fill again with white Clouds; now continue the Fire in this degree, for the ſpace of three days and nights, letting it then go out.</hi> § 20. The Veſſels being cold, decant the Spirit into a glaſs Body, ſet it in Sand, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately fit to it a Head with its Receiver, and diſtil with a
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57532:58"/>very gentle Fire four or five Ounces; this is the <hi>Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> which keep by itſelf in a Glaſs cloſe ſtopt. Change the Receiver, and augmenting the Fire di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtil about half the Liquor which remains; this is the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid Spirit of Vitriol. That which yet remains in the glaſs Body is the moſt acid part of the Vitriol, and is called Oyl, thô improperly, and may be uſed like the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid Spirit in continual Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and other Diſtempers which proceed from a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent heat. In the bottom of the Retort remains the <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> which is called <hi>Colcothar,</hi> out of which is eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the <hi>Sal Vitrioli, The Sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptick Water of Rabel,</hi> and <hi>Ens Veneris.</hi> § 21. As to the choice of the Vitriol, <hi>Lemery</hi> adviſes to take <hi>green Engliſh Vitriol,</hi> ſuch as (ſaith he) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rubbed upon Iron, does not at all change colour, which ſhews that it does not partake of Copper, as the <hi>German</hi> does, that looks a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle blewiſh, and is more acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious. § 22. There comes alſo a great deal of Flegm into the Receiver, which is known to be all come off, when there drops no more. When the volatile ſulphurous Spirits come, you muſt then be very careful of the Fire, for they come with a great deal of violence, and will break the Retort, if driven too furiouſly. They being come forth, you muſt then augment the Fire to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and laſt degree of all, for the acid Spirit will not part with its Earth, unleſs forced by an extraordinary heat. § 23. From <abbr>lb</abbr>viij. of Vitriol calcin'd (ſixteen Ounces to the pound) you will have of Flegm ℥xvij. of the volatile ſulphurous Spirit, and acid Spirit together ℥xxiiſs. of which twenty two Ounces and half, there will be of the volatile ſulphurous Spirit about four or five Ounces: and in the Retort you will have <abbr>lb</abbr>v.℥v. of <hi>Colcothar.</hi> § 24. That if you uſe <hi>German Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol</hi> inſtead of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> you may have a little more Spirit than the proportion named, by reaſon of the Copper par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles contained in the <hi>Vitriol,</hi> it would ſmell ſomething like A F. and the matter remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Retort would be of a brown or darker colour. § 25. That no other Body is added to <hi>Vitriol</hi> in diſtillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as in the diſtillation of Nitre, becauſe its own Body contains Earth enough. § 26. That the Furnace ought to be very thick, that the heat of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57532:59"/>the Fire being little or none of it loſt through the pores, may the better act upon the Retort. § 27. That ſome in diſtilling <hi>Vitriol</hi> continue the Fire for four or five days together: and that if it ſhould be continued for three or four days longer, there would come forth a congeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Oyl of Vitriol, and Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, which is nothing but the more fixt part of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Vitriol, or common Oyl. § 28. That all acid Spirits are only salts made fluid by force of Fire, they thereby being diſengaged for their terreſtious parts; and that they may again be revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by affuſing them upon ſome proper Alcali. Thus <hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi> put upon <hi>Iron,</hi> and remaining there ſome time, does reincorporate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Vitriol. And <hi>Spirit of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,</hi> put upon Salt of Tartar, makes again <hi>Saltpeter.</hi> § 29. That the Cauſtick nature of the Oyl of Vitriol, and its fiery Corroſion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a repletion of the mineral Salt with fiery parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, without which it could never burn nor heat any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign matter put into it. § 30. If into a Tincture of Violets, or of the Sun-flower, you drop <hi>Sp. Vitrioli,</hi> it will preſently make it red; put into it <hi>Ol. Tartari,</hi> or of <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſhes,</hi> and it will recover its former colour again. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, put to the ſaid Tincture Oyl of Tartar, or Spirit of Sal Armoniack, and the <hi>blew Tincture</hi> will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently turn <hi>green;</hi> put then into it a little <hi>Sp. Vitrioli,</hi> and it will be an obſcure red. A Tincture of red Roſes in warm fair Water, will be very weak and mean; if thereinto you drop a little <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> it will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately be of a high <hi>red:</hi> drop into it afterwards <hi>Ol. Tartari,</hi> it will become of a dirty black. § 31. So alſo, a decoction of <hi>Brazil, Log<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> or <hi>Brazilletto,</hi> being very red, if you drop into it <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> it turns it yellow; and then if you add <hi>Volatile Spirit of Sal Armoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack,</hi> it will become black: if alſo you drop Oyl of Tartar into Claret, it becomes <hi>gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,</hi> but adding a little Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Vitriol it returns to its former colour again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now all theſe changes of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour made by theſe differing Salts, do really ariſe only from the different poſition of the particles of Bodies diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Liquor, and their diſpoſition to modifie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the light ſeveral and different ways. § 32. Some
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57532:59"/>Authors <hi>put Vitriol into a Glaſs Cucurbit in an Aſh heat, covered with its Head and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, and well luting the Junctures, with a moderate heat they draw off the Flegm and acid Spirit, or</hi> Ros Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trioli, <hi>as much as they can force to aſcend; then they co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hobate the diſtilled Liquor up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Paeces, diſtilling and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hobating ſeven or eight times and redoubling the heat in the laſt diſtillation, they at length draw forth a Flegm mixt with much acid Spirit, which is of a very grateful odour, being cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated in a Sand heat with a Fire of digeſtion, in a Glaſs well cloſed.</hi> § 33. <hi>The Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the volatile ſulphurous Spirit of Vitriol.</hi> It is good againſt Palſies, Aſthma's, and Diſeaſes of the Lungs, it alſo diſſipates pains of the Head, eaſes the Megrim, and cures the Epilepſy, and Apoplexy, and indeed moſt Diſeaſes of the Head, Nerves, Breaſt, and Lungs, it opens, cuts, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuates, abſterges, reſolves viſcous humors, reſiſts putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and heals Ulcers of the Lungs, and Spitting Blood.

                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>Salmon.]</hi> § 1. There are ſeveral ways to diſtil the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Guajacum, of which the two following are chief: ℞ <hi>Raſpings of Guajacum, q. v. ſo much as may fill your Veſſel two thirds full, pour upon it Rain-water, ſo much as may nearly fill the Veſſel, and with Sugar make it to ferment eight or ten days:</hi> Or, ℞ <hi>Raſpings of Guajacum, q. v. put upon them White-wine, or other <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine q. s. digeſt forty eight hours:</hi> Or, ℞ <hi>Raſpings, q. v. Spirit of Wine, Water A. q. s. mix and digeſt: put all into a Copper Veſica tinn'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, with its Alembick-Head tinn'd within, its Worm, and Receiver: diſtil firſt with a gentle Fire, and continue the diſtillation, till about one half or two thirds of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor is drawn off; ſo will you have ſubtil Spirit, with ſome few drops of Oyl.</hi> § 2. Or thus: ℞ Guajacum ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſped, or cut into ſmall bits or chips <abbr>lb</abbr>vj. put them into an earthen Retort, in a cloſe Furnace of Reverberation, with a large Recipient; make a very ſmall Fire at firſt, only by degrees to heat the Furnace and Retort, for about an hour; then increaſe it by degrees, till you ſee the watery part of the Wood to come over into the Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pient; continue and increaſe the Fire a little more, till you ſee white Vapours come out of the Retort like Clouds, which are a Sign that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid Salt and oily parts of the Guajacum begin to come forth: at which time open the Cover to the Duomo, and increaſe the Fire more and more, till your large Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver looks clear, at what time your diſtillation will be compleated; thus have you an acid Spirit repleat with a volatile Salt of Guajacum, and a blackiſh ſtinking Oyl. § 3. <hi>Lemery</hi> adviſes to fill a a large Retort three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters full of the ſhavings or chips of Guajacum, and in a large Reverberatory with a great capacious Receiver, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtil, firſt with a very gentle Fire, only to warm the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort, and to diſtil the Water or Flegm, continue it in this condition till there comes no more drops, which is a ſign that all the Flegm is come off: fit again the Receiver to the neck of the Retort, luting the Juncture well, then increaſe the Fire gradatim,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57532:65"/>ſo will the Spirit and Oyl come forth in white Clouds, continue the Fire till no more will come, let the Veſſels cool, and unlute them. § 4. Then put that which is in the Retort into a Funnel lined with brown Paper, ſo will the Spirit paſs through, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the thick, black, and very fetid Oyl behind in the Paper, which being ſet into another Bottle, and the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of the Paper being pierced with a Bodkin, the Oyl will alſo drop through, which you may keep for uſe: Or you may rectifie it by mixing it with as much Sand, Bone-aſhes, or Tobacco-pipe-Clay in Pouder, as will make it into a Paſte, and then put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it into a Retort, place it in a Furnace in a nacked Fire; you may draw off the Oyl by a moderate Diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which will be much more pure than it was before. § 5. If you make the Spirit by § 2. it ought to be recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in a Glaſs Cucurbit, over a Sand heat, with its Head and Receiver; and having ſeparated the almoſt inſipid Water, which will firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, receiver and keep a part the ſpiritous and volatile acid and ſalt part, which will ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and be attended with an o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y Volatile, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains alſo itts part of the vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Salt, and may alſo be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated and kept apart as well as the acid, and be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred inwardly, being mixed with fine poudered Sugar, and given in any fit Liquor. § 6. After the very ſame manner and method you may diſtil a Spirit and Oyl from the <hi>Cortex,</hi> which may alſo in the ſame manner be rectified, having all the ſame Properties and Virtues of the Wood. § 7. This is alſo to be obſerved, That during the Diſtillation of the Spirit (after the Flegm is come off) you muſt not make the Fire too ſtrong, for they coming forth with a great deal of violence, would then be apt to break either the Retort or Receiver. § 8. Guajacum alſo, thô a dry Body, yet yields a great quantity of Liquor: for from 64 Ounces of the Wood, you will have 39 Ounces of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Flegm, and five Ounces and half of Oyl, and nineteen Ounces of Coals, from which you may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract four or ſix Drams of an alcalious or fixt Salt, which Salt is aperitive and ſudorifick, and may ſerve to fortifie any Vehicle againſt the <hi>French</hi> Diſeaſe, being given from 10. gr. to 30.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57532:66"/>§ 9. The Spirit of Guajacum is nothing but a diſſolution of the eſſential Salt of the Wood in a portion of its Flegm. It is Sudorifick and Nephritick; it is much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded in Diſeaſes of the Bladder, to purifie the Maſs of Blood, ſo that ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that by continuing the uſe of it for ſeveral Weeks à <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>j. ad iij. <hi>plus-minus,</hi> in its own Water, from four to eight Ounces, it is able to expel and carry off, through the pores of the skin, the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal Venom, eſpecially if not too inveterate, without making uſe of Mercury. It is good for the Cure of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal Ulcers which happen in the Mouth, or other parts, being mixt with <hi>Aqua Mellis.</hi> It is diaphoretick from its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repleat with volatile Salt, and is given againſt all ſorts of Rheumatiſms, Scurvey, Gout, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from half a Dram to two or three Drams, in a Glaſs full of the Decoction of the ſame Wood, eſpecially when it is required to expel the ſharp Seroſities by Sweat, or ſenſible Tranſpiration. § 10. The Oyl ſtinks above meaſure, and therefore is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom uſed inwardly by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its ill ſcent; but out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly it is ſucceſsfully uſed for the cure of all ſorts of Ulcers, chiefly Venereal, to cleanſe Wounds, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume proud Fleſh, as alſo for the opening and exfoliation of Bones, and to reſiſt Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. It is plainly of a fiery nature, and has both a Cathartick &amp; Cauſtick force: but mixed and prepared with S. V. rectified, it may be taken inwardly with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sudorificks, and Alexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharmicks againſt the Plague and malign Feavers, as alſo againſt the <hi>French-Pox,</hi> Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, Apoplexy, Epilepſy, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterick Fits, Vapours, Pains of the Teeth, and the like; and Authors affirm, that ſome have been cured of the Pox, by the conſtant uſe of this Oyl for ſome Weeks, from four to ten or twelve, drops, in a ſmall Decoction of the Wood. Inwardly given, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, it drives forth the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth: outwardly it is indeed a good thing for rottenneſs of the Bones, and to cleanſe old Ulcers, as I ſaid before; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to ripen Apoſthumes and Venereal Bubo's, and reſolve cold Tumours. § 11. <hi>Le Mort</hi> rectifies the Spirit by itsſelf in a Retort, and ſays, it contains a double Spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> a volatile and an acid Spirit: both which you may ſeparate after this manner: ℞ Spirit of Guajacum <abbr>lb</abbr>j. put

From hence it appears, that the Spirit drawn only with
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57532:71"/>ſulphurous Spirits, or that Spirit drawn only with acid or ſaline Spirits, cannot be altogether ſo forcible as Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures drawn with the ſame; for the firſt contain only an Opiate Sulphur, with little or none of the volatile Salt: and the other contains chiefly a volatile opiatick Salt, with little or nothing of an opiate Sulphur. But that Spirit which is drawn with a ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous acid Spirit, or ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous ſaline Spirit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains both an opiatick Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, and an acid volatile or urinous volatile Salt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in the ſame proportion that the Tincture does, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be made with a ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous, acid, or ſaline Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum. § 14. Theſe Spirits are all of them much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanter than either the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures or Extract of Opium, or any preparation of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um which contains the Body of the Concrete; for they never make the ſtomach ſick; as thoſe other oftentimes do; nor yet diſturb the Head o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than it is poſſible Spirit of Wine may do, which is a conſiderable advantage in their Operation. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' they are not altogether ſo ſtrong and forcible as is Tincture or Extract of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, yet they operate with much more ſpeed and ſafety than poſſibly the others can; for they fly like lightning through the whole Body, and give eaſe and relief not only to the Spirits, but to the whole Body almoſt in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. § 15. Theſe Spirits are not capable of theſe ill effects which uſually happen from other Preparations of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um; they ſuppreſs not the excretion of Excrements, nor ſtop the paſſages of Urine, they benumb not, nor ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the Limbs, nor change the natural complexion of the skin to paleneſs; they neither cauſe cold ſweats nor yet ſhortneſs of Breath, or difficulty of breathing, with a perturbation of the Senſes, drowſineſs and ſtupefaction of the Animal and Vital Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; but they have all the good effects which are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the moſt excellent Laudanums, thô not with the ſelf-ſame ſtrength and force. § 16. They appeaſe all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations, inteſtine and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Commotions of the Body; Diſquietings, Rage, Fury, and Madneſs of the Archeus, (the principal Director of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Life,) reſtoring again Peace and Concord, and maintaining it between the Faculties and Motions of the Body; ſo that after they have
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57532:71"/>ſoftly and ſilently (as it were) appeaſed the pain, and allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Grief, they procure a quiet and pleaſant reſt and ſleep, reſtore Nature to its priſtine ſtate, and repair the decayed ſtrength, whereby unthought-of Health comes on, with a violent carreere, and takes poſſeſſion of its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Habitation: Extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all Ages and Sexes, and in what Condition ſoever the ſharpneſs and anguiſh of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes.

                        <hi>Salmon.]</hi> § 1. Spirit of Amber is alſo twofold: 1. The Acid Spirit. 2. A Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Spirit made with <hi>Spirit of Wine.</hi> § 2. ℞ <hi>Amber groſly beaten, put it into an Earthen Retort, ſo as to fill it Two Thirds full; fit to it a large Receiver, luting the Juncture cloſe: Make a gentle fire firſt
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57532:74"/>only to warm the Retort, then augment it gradatim, till the Spirit and Oyl come forth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing the fire till no more diſtils: When cold, and unlu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, put about a Pint of fair warm Water into the Receiver, and ſtirring it ſoundly about, diſſolve the Volatile Salt, which many times ſticks to the ſides of the Receiver. Put all this Liquor into a Glaſs Alembick, fit to it a Receiver, and luting well the Junctures, make firſt a very gentle fire, which aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by degrees, ſo will the Flegm and Spirit aſcend, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them a little White Oyl; Continue the fire till no more ariſes, ſo will the thick Oyl be left at bottom.</hi> § 3. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the Flegm and Spirit from the White Oyl; and the Black Oyl (if you ſo pleaſe) you may rectifie from Colcothar or Bone-Aſhes, as is often afore-directed. The <hi>Flegm</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> yet remains together, which you muſt thus ſeparate: <hi>Put them into an Earthen or Glaſs Diſh, and evaporate it about two thirds over a gentle fire, that which remains is the Acid Spirit of Amber, which keep in a Vial cloſe ſtopt for uſe.</hi> § 4. Where note, That there is little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for this trouble of evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the Flegm; for you cannot ſo ſecurely do it, but that ſome of the Volatile Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Particles will go along with it, which will be a loſs to you: And what need is there of thus ſeparating its own natural Flegm from it? for that when it is done, the Spirit cannot be given alone, but muſt be mixt with ſome other Flegmatick Vehicle to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey it in: And if ſo, why ſhould not its own Flegm be as good as any thing For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, for that a leſs quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of another Vehicle would then ſerve the turn? § 5. The Black Oyl remaining in the bottom of the Cucurbit, by reaſon of its fetidneſs is ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fit to be given inwardly without rectification; but it may be kept for outward uſe to anoint the Noſes and Wriſts, of Women troubled with Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors and Fits of the Mother. § 6. <hi>But if you would rectifie it, mix it with ſo much Sand as is neceſſary to make it into a Body, which put into a Retort, place it in a Furnace, and force over the Oyl, ſo will it come over-red, but exceeding clear, which is to be kept by it ſelf, and may ſerve inſtead of the White.</hi> § 7. This, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the White Oyl, may be given inwardly in all Hyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick Diſtempers, Palſies, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poplexies, Epilepſies, Verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go's, Lethargies, and other
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57532:74"/>Diſtempers of the Brain, Nerves and Womb. Doſe <hi>à gut. ij ad x.</hi> § 8. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is an excellent Aperitive, and is ſucceſsfully given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the aforeſaid Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, but chiefly againſt the Epilepſie, Jaundice, Stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page of Urine, Ulcers in the Neck of the Bladder, Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey, Cachexia, Dropſies, Rheumatiſms, and other the like Diſeaſes; for that this Spirit is only the Volatile Salt of Amber, diſſolved in ſome of its Flegm, and may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven à gut. xij. ad xxx. in ſome convenient Liquor. The Oyl may be diſſolved with the Yolk of an Egg, by grinding them together, whereby it will eaſily mix with any Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Wine or Broath. § 9. If you would ſeparate the Salt from the Flegm, you may do thus: <hi>Evaporate about a third part of the Spirit over a very gentle fire, then put the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder into a cool place, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it there ten or twelve days without ſtirring it, ſo will it cryſtallize, which you are to take and keep in a Vial cloſe ſtopt.</hi> § 10. But here is to be noted, that it is much better to keep the Salt with its Flegm, for in Evaporation (tho' with never ſo gentle a Fire) ſome part of it will fly away; beſides, it is eaſier kept with its flegm, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from it, becauſe it will be apt to diſſolve. § 11. This Salt is acid, and like unto the eſſential Salt of Plants, and being leſs volatile than that of Animals cannot riſe ſo high in rectification, and being heavier than the flegm, lets the flegm riſe firſt, for which reaſon we chuſe the method of cryſtallizing it, rather than that of ſubliming it. But there is an excellent and ſubtil volatile Salt of Amber to be made by ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from the Amber it ſelf, of which we ſhall ſay nothing here, but reſerve you to its determined place: Theſe Salts of Amber have the Virtues of the Spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned. § 12. The ſulphurous Spirit of Amber, made with Spirit of Wine, is done as we have taught in our <hi>Pharmacopoeia Londinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> lib. 4. cap. 3. ſect. 39. where <hi>Amber in Pouder, p. i. is mixt with rectified S. V. p. ij. them put into a Retort ſo as to fill it not above half full, to which is fitted a large Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, without luting (for that if luted, the S. V. would break all the Veſſels) and then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling with a gentle fire, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing it gradatim, and at laſt giving a fire of ſuppreſſion; you will have the ſulphurous,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57532:75"/>ſpirituous and volatile Spirit of Amber, equal in quantity to the Spirit of Wine, and a black fetid Oyl, equal to half the weight of the Amber, which you must ſeparate.</hi> § 13. This ſulphurous volatile Spirit has all the Virtues of the former Spirit and Oyl, and infinitely more pleaſant to be taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, being a Specifick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Hyſterick Fits, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepſies and all cold and moiſt Diſtempers of the Head, Brain, Nerves, Womb, and Joynts: and may be given à ℈i. ad <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>i. in any proper and ſpecifick Vehicle. § 14. Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, it is a moſt admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing againſt the Palſie, Lameneſs, Numbneſs, Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of the Limbs, or Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of any ſingular Part, the Cold Gout, and all manner of Aches and Pains proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a cold Cauſe, and Bruiſes or Hurts of the Nerves, it is of very thin and ſubtil parts, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its penetrative faculty is reſolutive and diſcuſſive: It cures Contractions and Sinews ſhrunk up, from its balſamick property, and reſtores ſuch as have loſt the uſe of their Limbs: drawn up the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils often at one time, and the Head well bathed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with alſo, gives immediate eaſe in the Head-ache, tho' never ſo extream, and that even upon the ſpot.</p>

                     <p n="3">§ 3. In this heat (whether in B. M. or Sand) the Spirit will begin to ſimper, and preſently after the Sulphur will melt, and ting the Oyl of a deep red colour: the fire is to be ſo govern'd as to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Oyl from boyling, and in about two hours time the Operation will be done; yet it will be better to keep it in the ſame heat for three or four hours longer.</p>

                     <p n="5">§ 5. There is no need of a great Fire for this operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe the Sulphur being a fat Body, does eaſily incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate with Oyls, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly gives them a red co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, that which remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſolved in the Matraſs, <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery</hi> ſays, is the acid or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line part of the Sulphur, and is found cryſtallized.</p>

                     <p n="7">§ 7. <hi>Le Mort</hi> firſt mixes the Flowers, p. ij. with Salt of Tartar, p. j. by exactly melting them together, till they are of a blackiſh purple colour, then poudering the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:57532:94"/>Maſs, adds to it double the weight of the Flowers of the Oyl of Turpentine, and then boyls them in a Glaſs Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſs in Sand for three hours, after which being cold, he ſeparates the clear Balſam for uſe.</p>
                     <p n="8">§ 8. And this addition of Salt of Tartar may ſeem ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, for that thereby the Body of the Sulphur is in a great meaſure opened, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it the eaſier diſſolves and yields its Tincture to the Oyl: and tho' without the Salt of Tartar the ſubſtance of the Sulphur will diſſolve in the Oyl; yet by the help there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Balſam is made much more efficacious. So that this Balſam thus made, is nothing but a conjunction of the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, or its oily parts, with diſtilled Oyls, which by the addition of a fixed Salt is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celerated, for that it breaks the Chains of the acid, which holds the particles of the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous Body together.</p>

The ordinary Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Coral reduces it into a Pouder almoſt impal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, grinding it upon Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry; but it may be better done, with the Engine of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Joel Langelot,</hi> Phyſician to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Holſatia,</hi> which is an exquiſite kind of Steel-Mill: this opens the Body well, and divides it almoſt into imperceptible Atoms, and recommends this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to all other Preparations which require any mixt Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be reduced into minute parts.</p>

The Filings or Pieces of Iron ought to be fully ruſted before-hand, which may be done by ſpreading them in a broad Trey, or Earthen Pan, and expoſing them for ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time all Night in the open Air, ſo as the Dew may effectually fall thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: or otherwiſe, they may be daily ſprinkled with Rain-water, and permitted each time to dry, ſtirring them conſtantly every day, till ſuch times as their tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Ruſting is compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p n="2">§ 2. This done (whereby the Body of the Iron will be in a good meaſure opened) put this ruſted Matter into a Bolt-head with a long Neck, and affuſe thereon, to every ℥i.. a pint of choice Red (or rather in my Opinion White-) Wine, which digeſt for ſome days, till the Wine has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the Tincture there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from.</p>
                     <p n="3">§ 3. Our Author here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes to digeſt only for two days, but I, who have many times made it, can tell you, that the longer you digeſt it, the better it is; and if it be digeſted two Months, yea, four or ſix Months, it will be yet ſo much the better, and more efficacious to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes intended.</p>
                     <p n="4">§ 4. It not only opens all manner of Obſtructions, but moſt effectually cures the Green-ſickneſs in Virgins; and it performs this Cure ſo admirably, that it is even to a wonder, for the Perſon who even but now lookt pale, wan, and thin, obſtructed in the Breſt and Lungs, ſo that they could hardly breath, without Stomach, loathing all manner of Food, ſcarce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to move or ſtir, without much uneaſineſs or trouble, nor hardly able to go up Stairs, without blowing, as if they ſtrove for Life, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in an extream manner, and ſeemingly as it were in a very deep Conſumption; ſuch
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:57532:120"/>a Perſon as this, has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieved, as it were, out of the Jaws of Death, and by taking of but two Doſes ſo ſenſibly benefited, that all who converſed with them could not but take notice of it: the ſhortneſs of Breath, difficulty of Breathing went away, the Sick was pleaſant and eaſie, began to eat with a good Stomach, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Food with a great deal of pleaſure; and in a word, the whole Habit of the Body did ſeem to be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging.</p>
                     <p n="5">§ 5. This is indeed the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and property of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament; if then it does thus much at two or three times taking, what may it be thought to effect, if its uſe be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued for ſome reaſonable time? The truth of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is this; no certain ſpace of time can be limited for the taking thereof, but it muſt be according to the nature of the Body afflicted, obduracy of the Obſtructions, and length of time wherein the Diſeaſe has prevailed; ſome need not take it above three Weeks or a Month at moſt; whereas other ſome again, muſt be obliged to take it for two or three Months; yea, ſometimes for four or five Months, or longer.</p>
                     <p n="6">§ 6. The ſick ought to take it for ſome conſiderable time after they ſeem to be well; for this Diſeaſe being of a ſtubborn and rebellious nature, and not eaſily rooted out, may leave its Seeds or Roots behind it; and thô the Body of the Tree, be as it were cut down, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſeems to be perfectly well, yet (the uſe of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine being given over too ſoon) the Diſeaſe revives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain out of the remanent Seeds or Roots, contrary to all expectation, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient becomes preſently as bad again, or worſe than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                     <p n="7">§ 7. In ſuch caſes as theſe it is requiſite, that the Sick ſhould begin as at firſt, and then to continue the taking of it ſo long, till it is evident a perfect Cure is compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p n="8">§ 8. Doſe three, four, five or ſix ſpoonfuls in a Glaſs of White-wine, Ale, or Mild Beer, and to be taken either at Night going to Bed: or if in the Morning, ſo as the Sick may lie or keep their Bed two or three hours after taking it, and this ſo long till they have gotten ſtrength e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſtir more, and go abroad, then it may be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be at work, and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious

                     <p n="7">§ 7. But before you uſe this Remedy ſome Cautions are neceſſary to be premiſed: I. That you never uſe it to ſuch Women who have an Obſtruction of the Menſes, or are troubled with the Green-ſickneſs, nor to other perſons who are frequently afflicted with a Conſtipation of the Bowels, or have a continent or continual Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, whether putrid, malign, or peſtilential; for in the caſe of all thoſe kinds of Feavers, it is commonly mortal, and does the work as ſurely in a manner as if the Hangman did it.</p>
                     <p n="8">§ 8. About the time of the writing of this, I knew four men ſeiz'd with a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Feaver, two were high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly malignant, and the other two more apparently the Spotted-Feaver; two Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, of great names, but no Phyſicians, were ſent for, who preſently preſcribed the <hi>Pulvis Patrum,</hi> and in three days time the Victim yielded to the fatal blow. Afterwards to the ſecond they gave the ſame in like manner, who died the fourth day. To the third they gave it alſo, who had the Spotted-Feaver, and he died in 2 days. They yet continued to give the ſame Medicine to a fourth, and in order after they had ſeen the ill effects in the former three, and this likewiſe became a Sacrifice with the reſt.</p>
                     <p n="9">§ 9. Another Youth fell ſick (after the other four) with the Spotted-Feaver, to whom the ſame perſons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the ſame courſe, (ſo ſenceleſs, or rather wilful and ignorant, were thoſe Coblets and Botchers in Phyſick, thoſe Legal, as they ſay, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg'd Quacks:) but the Relations of the Youth ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Maſſacres of the other four juſt before their Eyes, would not yield to it, but forbad their fatal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; and having ſome knowledge of me, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came to me, and carried me to the Sick; I view'd the Patient, and they told me what had been preſcrib'd; I confeſs I forbad it, as they va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued their Sons and Relations Life, and counſelled to other things; my Advice was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and the young man recovered, did well, and is now abroad and healthy again, tho' in the Opinion of all that ſaw him, the Hope of Life was paſt. I cured a ſecond Patient in the ſame Houſe, of the ſame Diſeaſe, tho' delirious, by the very ſame method, who is now alive and well; and alſo a
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:57532:166"/>third, in the ſame place, who after fell ſick, and with the ſame Medicines, with the ſame good ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p n="10">§ 10. I give this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe Experiences to convince, if poſſible, thoſe <hi>Homicides</hi> of their Barbarity and Male practiſe, and to give the unthinking World a Caution to be no more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon for the future, by ſuch baſe, ignorant, mercenary and mercileſs, yet vainglorious Pretenders to Phyſick. But to proceed.</p>
                     <p n="11">§ 11. II. Let the Patient be firſt very well cleanſed, both upwards and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, by ſome general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, ſuch as are the <hi>Tartar Emetick of Mynſicht, Infuſion of Crocus Metallorum,</hi> or <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Benedictum, Antimoniale,</hi> or <hi>ſome ſuchlike;</hi> and for the greater Security ſake, purge them alſo, either with our <hi>Family-pills or Family-pouder,</hi> or <hi>an Infuſion of Sena, Electu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arium Lenitivum,</hi> or other Medicines proper to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
                     <p n="12">§ 12. This being done, you may now come ſafely to the uſe of the <hi>Cortex,</hi> or of this <hi>Tincture;</hi> for the Malignity and Morbifick Cauſe being thus generally carried off, you need not fear the ſhutting it up, and lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it into the Body to do more miſchief, the which if not carried off, it muſt infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly do.</p>
                     <p n="13">§ 13. What muſt become of the Venom in a malign and peſtilential Feaver, when by this Medicament it is lockt up within the Body? When by it the <hi>Diaphoreſis</hi> is hindered, the Pores of the Body conſtringed, and the other Paſſages by it ſtopt up, ſo that there is no way made for the Poyſon to paſs off or tranſpire; doubtleſs it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currs to the Center and ſmites the Heart and Vitals in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and immediately makes the miſerable Patient a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to Ignorance and Pride: The truth of which Poſition I think was too well verified or made out in the four above enumerated Examples.</p>
                     <p n="14">§ 14. It now remains, that we ſhew for what Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions this Remedy is uſed, and the Order, Method, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of taking it. The Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it is moſt proper againſt, and for which it is a Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick, are all ſorts of intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Feavers, vulgarly called Agues, (in the caſes of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent or continual Feavers it is as bad as Poyſon) and in all Fluxes of Blood, as ſpitting of Blood, bleeding at the Noſe, overflowing of the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:57532:166"/>Menſes, a Dyſentery, and the Hepatick Flux, and indeed in all other Fluxes of the Bowels, or Fluxes of ſharp Humors upon the Lungs cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Catarrhs, or upon the Limbs and Joynts, called a Rheumatiſm. In theſe and the like caſes it is the moſt famed Remedy in the World, nor is there any Remedy yet found out, that is equal to it in Vertue and Goodneſs, for thoſe Intentions, and if right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed, and given by a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, prudent, and honeſt Hand, it is as ſafe as it is ſure and excellent.</p>

This Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript is from <hi>Lemery,</hi> but by all that is ſaid, it does not appear of what kind the Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers are, of which this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtery is to be made; they are twofold, <hi>viz.</hi> a ſublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Tin, either with <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> or with <hi>Nitre:</hi> What the latter is, we ſhall ſhew in its place; what the former is (which without doubt is the Subject of this Preſcript) we ſhall here ſhew.</p>
                     <p n="2">§ 2. Flowers of Tin, with Sal Armoniack, from <hi>Lemery.</hi> ℞ <hi>Tin, p. j. Sal Armoniack in pouder p. ij. mix them well together, put them into a ſtrong earthen Cucurbit, ſo large, as that not above a third part may be full, fit to it a blind Head, luting the Juncture, and place the Veſſel on the Grate in a ſmall Fornace and a naked Fire, and only ſo open, as that the Fire may paſs through the Regiſters, for which reaſon you muſt ſtop up the top of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace with Bricks and Lime, leaving ſome holes in the ſides, which are called Regiſters, and let the Cucurbit enter a third
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:57532:190"/>part of its height into the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace; then make a Fire ſmall at firſt, and encreaſe it by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, till the bottom of the Cucurbit is red hot, which Fire continue till nothing more will ſublime, which you will know by the Heads growing cold, and then the ſublimation will be at an end; the Flowers will ſtick to the Head, and to the top of the Body, which take and keep for the making of the aforeſaid Magiſtery.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">§ 3. Theſe Flowers are nothing but ſome Particles of the Tin, raiſed up by the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latility of the Sal Armoniack, and at the bottom of the Body you will find ſome of the Tin revived.</p>
                     <p n="4">§ 4. But that this may be the more effectually done, your Tin ought firſt to be reduced into a Calx by the means of Fire, for the better mixing it with the Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack, which is thus done: <hi>Put Tin into a large unglaz'd earthen Pan, place it in a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Fire, ſo will the Tin melt, then stir it with a Spatula, till it comes into a pouder, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a great Fire to it</hi> 36 <hi>hours, stirring it from time to time, ſo will you have the Calx of Tin fit for ſublimation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">§ 5. In this Operation an unglaz'd Earthen Veſſel is uſed, leſt the Lead with which it is glaz'd ſhould mix with the Tin, and hurt its Purity; and the Veſſel is broad, that it might by ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring be the ſooner reduced to Pouder, in which it will be eaſier done in 36 hours, than in 4 or 5 days in a Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                     <p n="6">§ 6. It is impoſſible to make Tin aſcend in Flowers without any mixture; and therefore, tho' the mixture of Salts may be found fault with, yet ſince it is not to be ſublimed without them, it muſt be born withal, but the fault is the leſs, by reaſon of the facility of ſeparating the ſaid Salts again from the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal by Lotion, of which our Author's Preſcript here gives the Example.</p>
                     <p n="7">§ 7. Some take equal quantities of Tin and Sal Armoniack; but <hi>Charras</hi> takes <hi>Calx of Tin,</hi> ℥<hi>iij. Sal Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack</hi> ℥xij. <hi>and being mixt in fine pouder, he ſublimes in a good Aludel upon a proper For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, covered with</hi> 3 <hi>or</hi> 4 <hi>of its pots, one upon another, and the Junctures well luted, and the uppermoſt covered with a little Head, then kindles a Coal-Fire under the Aludel, encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it by degrees, till the Alu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del is red hot in all its lower parts, at which time he throws in at the hole about</hi> ℥<hi>ſs. of the
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:57532:191"/>pouder, and then cloſes it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, by which means the Tin and Sal Armoniack riſe together in Vapors, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſe in Flowers, on the inſides of the Pots; then throws in another like quantity at the hole, and repeats this Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion till all the pouder is ſpent, keeping a good Fire under the Aludel, to facilitate the ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Tin which by this means will be all ſublimed.</hi>

                     <p n="3">§ 3. Here is to be noted, that if you ſhould uſe only Water, you would make but a kind of Virgins Milk, and the Saturn would not diſſolve but precipitate, leaving ſome particles of its Body yet in the Water; wherefore it is better to take equal quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Water and <hi>Spirit of Vinegar,</hi> for thereby the Salt will be diſſolved, into which dropping the <hi>alcalious Oyl of Tartar,</hi> the edges or points of the Acid are deſtroyed, which held up the Salt, and the matter precipitates by its own weight.</p>
                     <p n="4">§ 4. In this Operation there is no efferveſcency, for the Acids of the Vinegar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broken and weakened, it has not ſtrength nor activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty enough left to enter the Pores of the Salt of Tartar, ſo as to make ſuch an opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and it is the ſame in all other ſubſtances diſſolved by Vinegar; but if the Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be performed with ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Acids, as Oyls of Vitriol or Sulphur, Spirit of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> an Ebulition is made.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">§ 2. Now the difference between this Preſcript, and that of our Author is only this; that whereas <hi>Schroder,</hi> or rather <hi>Hartman,</hi> preſcribes but an equal quantity of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with the Mercury, and the operation to be three times repeated with the ſame quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of freſh Spirit. Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor preſcribes a trebble quantity of Spirit at once, and the ſame to be 3 times cohobated, which to me ſeems to make the Preparation the better by all the Cohobations, though <hi>Lemery</hi> ſeems to be of another opinion. He makes it thus.</p>
                     <p n="3">§ 3. ℞ <hi>Mercury revived from Cinnaber</hi> ℥<hi>viij. Spirit of Nitre</hi> ℥<hi>viij. or ix. mix, and
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:57532:199"/>diſſolve, put the diſſolution in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Vial or Matraſs with a ſhort Neck, ſet in Sand, and evaporate all the moiſture with a gentle heat, until there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a white Maſs, then quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Fire by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, to the third degree, and keep it in this condition till all the matter is turned red, then take it off from the Fire, let it cool, and break the Vial, ſo will you have</hi> ℥<hi>ix. of Precipitate. Some put this red Precipitate into an earthen Pot, and pour upon it S. V. well rectified, then fire it, letting it burn till it is conſumed, and then adding more, and burning it off as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: They repeat this Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of deflagration ſix times, and call it</hi> Arcanum Coralli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</p>
                     <p n="4">§ 4. Now here is to be noted, that <hi>Lemery</hi> is of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the diſtilling Spirit of Nitre three times off from the white Maſs, or cohoba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it, to the encreaſe of its redneſs, is of no uſe, and as I apprehend him, adds no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the Vertue of the Medicine.</p>
                     <p n="5">§ 5. But that it reduces the Maſs into ſmaller Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, is apparent; for if ℥<hi>iij.</hi> of <hi>Spirit of Nitre</hi> will reduce the <hi>Mercury</hi> into Particles ſo fine, ℥<hi>ix.</hi> of <hi>Spirit,</hi> from the ſame reaſon, muſt reduce it into Particles three times as fine. And this was the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Paracelſus;</hi> and that the Particles at length might be made ſo fine, as to become Oily, elſe in vain was the Engine of <hi>Joel Langelot</hi> made, for the grinding of Gold, thereby to reduce it into Oil, if the ſmalneſs of the Particles added not ſomething to that Reduction.</p>
                     <p n="6">§ 6. And if the reducing of the <hi>Mercury</hi> into ſmall Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles accidentally add to the Vertue of the <hi>Mercury,</hi> by enlarging the ſurface thereof; if then by adding three times the quantity of <hi>Spirit,</hi> the Particles be made three times as ſmall, it follows by parity of Reaſon, that its Vertues muſt be three times as great.</p>
                     <p n="7">§ 7. The <hi>white Maſs</hi> which remains after the firſt evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the humidity, is a mixture of <hi>Mercury</hi> with a great many <hi>acid Spirits,</hi> for it weighs three ounces more than the <hi>crude Mercury</hi> did; and it is extreme corroſive and fiery, if applied to the Fleſh.</p>
                     <p n="8">§ 8. But according as it is calcin'd, to make it red, the Points of the Spirit of Nitre which cauſed the corroſion, do ſtrike off, and fly into the Air; whence it comes to paſs, that the more it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin'd,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:57532:199"/>the more we encreaſe in nedneſs, and the more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh its weight, and the leſs, it corrodes even in outward application. And therefore ſome Chyrurgions obſerving this, when they would make an Eſchar quickly, chuſe the Precipitate that is leſs red, or leſs red than uſual, the more red being leſs eſcharotick.</p>
                     <p n="9">§ 9. Therefore being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for ſome hours under the red Maſs, will cauſe it to ſublime, and yet ſtill retain its red colour, but <hi>this ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> is hot ſo corroſive as the <hi>other;</hi> from whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the Points or Acids of the <hi>Spirit of Salt</hi> are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to make a <hi>ſublimate</hi> very corroding.</p>
                     <p n="10">§ 10. And the reaſon why it will ſublime, is, becauſe the <hi>Mercury</hi> being freed from many of the <hi>acid Spirits,</hi> which did fix it, has power to ſublime with thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main; but becauſe thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Spirits do a little clog it in its career or volati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, it commonly makes its ſtation in the middle of the Vial.</p>
                     <p n="11">§ 11. <hi>Le Mort</hi> makes it in all reſpects as <hi>Schroder</hi> or <hi>Hartman</hi> does, but after the diſſolution and abſtraction of the Spirit of Nitre, he affuſes Spirit of Vinegar, ſo much as to overtop in 4 inches, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts two days, after evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates to dryneſs, then affuſes tartarized S. V. to overtop it 3 inches, digeſts and abſtracts in Sand to dryneſs, cohoba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſame Spirit upon the Mercury, ſo long till it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires an acidity. Laſtly, affuſes freſh Spirit of Wine upon the matter, and abſtract again, ſo have you an <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Corallinum,</hi> which you may keep under the name of <hi>Aurum Horizontalis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">§ 12. It brings forth all noxious humors in the French Pox, Leprofie, Kings-Evil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being given <hi>à gr. j. ad vj.</hi> It is a ſpecifick Purge in all ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerous Affects, or any vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Relique; and if pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently given with proper Catharticks, it cures the Dropſie, and all Diſeaſes proceeding from cold glaſſy Flegm and watery Humors.</p>
                     <p n="13">§ 13. <hi>Marggrave</hi> makes it of crude Mercury, and but double the Spirit of Nitre, with one ſingle diſſolution and abſtraction of the Spirit and calcination to redneſs, abſtracting ſeveral times from it the Alcohol of S.

                     <p n="14">§ 14. <hi>Charras</hi> makes it thus: ℞ <hi>Quick-ſilver</hi> ℥<hi>iv. (revived from Cinnaber) Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Nitre</hi> ℥<hi>iv. put all into a

                     </p>
                     <p n="15">§ 15.

                     <p n="3">§ 3. Now here is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that Plates or Leaves of Gold are uſed in this Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that its diſſolution may the more eaſily be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: And you muſt put on the A.

<pb n="395" facs="tcp:57532:207"/>from what it was before, it is, ſo perfectly clear and tranſparent, except that it has received a golden colour, and is become yellow.</p>
                     <p n="4">§ 4. This diſſolution of Gold is only a <hi>ſuſpenſion</hi> of the Particles of the Metal in the Water, made by the Points of the A. R. for it is not enough, that the A. R. does divide the Gold into ſubtile Particles, but it is farther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that the ſaid points or edges ſhould hold up the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, otherwiſe they would alwaies fall to the bottom in a Pouder, though never ſo ſubtile.</p>
                     <p n="5">§ 5. Theſe acid edges are bodies exceeding light, in compariſon of the Particles of Gold, and they have their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies more extended, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently take up more room in the flegm, and this is that that holds them up, and makes them ſwim; for as a piece of Wood will ſwim in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and a piece of Metal ſink, yet if the Metal be fixt on the Wood, or ſuſpended by it, they both will ſwim toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p n="6">§ 6. The <hi>Oyl of Tartar,</hi> or <hi>Spirit of Sal Armoniack</hi> uſed in this Precipitation, contain each of them an <hi>alcalious Salt,</hi> which being mixed with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids, cauſes an immediate fermentation, in which the Parts of the A.

                     </p>
                     <p n="7">§ 7. Now the reaſon why the volatile <hi>Spirit of Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack</hi> weakens the A. R. which is compounded of <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> is this; The ſtrength of the A. R. not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſo much from the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile part of the <hi>Sal Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack,</hi> as from the <hi>Sea-ſalt,</hi> which in great plenty is mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, and from which indeed the mighty force of the A.

                     <p n="8">§ 8. From what has been ſaid it <hi>appears,</hi> that this Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is only Particles of
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:57532:208"/>Gold, impregnated with acid Spirits, which cauſes it, when ſet over the Fire, to give ſuch a loud or thundering crack.</p>

                     <p n="10">§ 10. Now the reaſon why the diſſolvent quits the Body it diſſolved and held up, is the adding ſome Body which by its motion and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure is able to engage the Acids, ſo much as to break them, whereby the Particles of Gold being at liberty, through their own weight they ſubſide; and this is done through any alcalious Salt: And ſuch are <hi>Oyl of Tartar.</hi> and <hi>volatile Spirit of Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack,</hi> which being very active Salts in their kind, and finding Bodies at reſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently move them, and by a quick and rapid motion ſhake them ſo violently, as to break the Points by which the metalline Particles were ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended; which fragments of Points being thus diſenga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the Gold, act now upon the <hi>alcalious Salt,</hi> pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and dividing their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles aſunder, which are much more ſoluble in their nature than the Gold; and from hence proceeds this new Ebulition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="11">§ 11. By this means the remaining A. R. is rendered uncapable of diſſolving any more Gold, becauſe it has no more power left of making a penetration: And the <hi>precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated Gold</hi> is impregnated with ſome parts of the Diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, for that <hi>the ſharpeſt part of theſe points</hi> remain within the Particles of the <hi>Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,</hi> in which they are ſo cloſely lock'd up, that though it be ſeveral times waſhed in warm Water, they cannot poſſibly be diſengaged from their hold.</p>
                     <p n="12">§ 12. And this is plainly apparent, when put upon the fire, from the great detona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or noiſe which is made, which can proceed from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the encloſed Spirits, which violently break the moſt compact body of Gold, to get ſpeedily out, when they are forc'd to it by the vertue of Fire.</p>

That <hi>Oyl of Sulphur</hi> is better for this Preparation than <hi>Oyl of Vitriol,</hi> you have the Suffrage of <hi>Crolliuc,</hi> who not only preſcribes <hi>Oyl of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi> but prefers it before all other corroſive Oyls, and affirms, that it far more powerfully precipitates and coagulates it than <hi>Oyl of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol,</hi> ſo that it will endure a much ſtronger Fire.

                        <hi>Salmon.]</hi> § 1. This is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Preparation, and the beſt of all the Precipitates, and therefore we ſhall be a little more exact in obſerving what Authors have ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it. <hi>Crollius</hi> makes it thus: <hi>Take a Glaſs flat and broad, (near a cubit in breadth) high, and very cloſe-neck'd, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an Orifice no bigger than a Needle may go into, turn'd in with a wide mouth, that the Mercury may be poured into it: Into this Glaſs put purified Quicksilver, ſo much as may every where cover the bottom, place it ſo exactly in Sand, that no part of the Mercury, by the unequal placing of the Glaſs, be either higher or lower; this done, decoct it at firſt with a gentle heat, then with a more ſtrong fire, till it becomes a moſt red pouder like Cinnabar, which edulcorate with Cordial Waters, or S.V.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">§ 2. This, <hi>ſays he,</hi> power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully provokes Sweat, and being 6 or 7 times exhibited in a <hi>Lues Venerea,</hi> it wholly roots out and exterminates the Diſeaſe; more eſpecially if other things neceſſary in this Cure be alſo duly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, it cures all ſorts of Feavers, both continual and intermitting.</p>
                     <p n="3">§ 3. <hi>Schroder</hi> makes it exactly after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but ſays it is a work of thirty days. Beſides the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Vertues, he ſays, it kills Worms, but vomits violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and commends it more if it be made with an eighth part of Gold.</p>
                     <p n="4">§ 4. <hi>Rolfincius Chym.</hi> lib. 5 ſect. 6. cap. 3. <hi>Prepares it in a like Veſſel, and almoſt after the ſame manner; in the ſpace of eight days he coagulates it, then breaks the Veſſel, grinds the matter into a moſt ſubtil pouder in a glaſs Mortar, then
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:57532:273"/>puts it again into a glaſs Veſſel, and digeſts in a ſand-heat for four or five days more, or till all things within grow black; he breaks the Veſſel again, and pulverizes the matter anem, putting it into a new Phial, and makes a calcination with an intenſe degree of Fire, till the Mercury riſes up or ſhoots forth into a kind of Grove (as it were) of little Trees, or a company of young Shoots and ſlender Sprigs growing together as out of the Ground, of an Orange-tawny or red colour, which by little and little fall down again.</hi> This, ſays he, looſens the Belly, provokes Sweat, and oftentimes cauſes vomiting.</p>
                     <p n="5">§ 5. <hi>Le Febure</hi> makes it thus: ℞ <hi>A double Veſſel, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Chymiſts</hi> Infernus, <hi>or</hi> A Hell, <hi>flat and broad in the bottom; put into it purified Quicksilver,</hi> i. e. <hi>revived from Cinnabar</hi> ℥<hi>iij. or iv. ſtop the upper part of it with a ſingle Paper, and place it in Sand equally in its poiſe, ſo as the Quicksilver may be evenly ſpread upon the whole bottom of the Veſſel, lying no thicker on one part than on another, that the Fire may equally work on the whole: Make at firſt a ſoft Fire, and encreaſe it by degrees, till all the Q. S. be changed, calcined, or precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated into a red Pouder, like Mineral-Cinnabar, very bright, ſhining and ſparkling to the Eye, then digeſt it the ſpace of</hi> 21 <hi>days in Alcohol of S.

                     </p>
                     <p n="6">§ 6. This, ſays he, is an univerſal Remedy againſt all Agues, and a true Specifick againſt the French Pox, which it radically cures, if given ſeven times to the Patient, to provoke Sweating, for it is an infallible Sudorifick. It kills alſo Worms in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, Guts, and <hi>Inteſtinum Rectum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">§ 7. The Doſe is <hi>à gr. ij. ad viij,</hi> in ſome Conſerve, Confection, or Cordial Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract; the Sick muſt keep his Bed when he uſes it, and muſt be ſure to be well co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, patiently expecting the <hi>Diaphoreſis,</hi> which will not fail to bring along with it the deſired effects.</p>
                     <p n="8">§ 8. Nor muſt the Artiſt himſelf grow weary in the preparation of this Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though the Operation be long and tedious, for he muſt take care to govern and manage the Fire with Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Diſcretion, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he will be often forced to begin his work anew, for
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:57532:274"/>a ſmall fault in the Fire will cauſe the Veſſel to break.</p>
                     <p n="9">§ 9. This Operation is very tedious, by reaſon of the length of time in which it is a doing, for it can ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be perfected under fourty days; yea, ſometimes it may be 90, 100, or 120 days, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may be accompliſhed, according as you take care to prepare your Mercury well or ill, and according to your care and aſſiduity in keeping and managing your Fire.</p>
                     <p n="10">§ 10. Now 'tis only <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> can rubifie <hi>Mercury,</hi> as evidently appears by its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction into <hi>Cinnabar,</hi> from which reaſon and the former operation of calcining it <hi>per ſe,</hi> it is evident, that common <hi>Quicksilver</hi> has a <hi>Sulphur</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and ſeparable from the Eſſence of <hi>Mercury.</hi> To this Experience we may add the Teſtimonies of <hi>Geber,</hi> and many other of the Ancients, and learned in this Art, who continually teſtifie the ſame.</p>
                     <p n="11">§ 11. When it is reſuſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated or regenerated out of <hi>Silver,</hi> or any other perfect Metal, ſo as to be exquiſite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleanſed from any foreign or poyſonous matter, and then according to Art preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated to a redneſs, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Medicine not to be deſpiſed, which provokes neither Stool nor Vomit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be given in an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Doſe.</p>
                     <p n="12">§ 12. The external Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur in <hi>Mercury</hi> (ſays <hi>Tache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>) is the cauſe of Vomit and Salivation, and not the corroſive Spirits with which it is <hi>precipitated</hi> or <hi>ſublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> which the very anointing with crude <hi>Quicksilver</hi> proves; wherein the acid <hi>Sulphur</hi> of the <hi>Mercury,</hi> piercing the Skin, after the manner of other <hi>Acids,</hi> joyning with the inward occult <hi>Acid</hi> of the Body, abſorbs the <hi>Alcaly</hi> of the Ventricles, and by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the internal <hi>Acid</hi> of the Body more acid, and a moſt ſtrong Poyſon, it extinguiſhes the alcalious faculty, and then reſolves, as Cauſticks do, all the Aliments and Juices of the Body into a putrid Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p n="13">§ 13. So this occult veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous acidity of the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Mercury</hi> does primarily hurt the Gums and Teeth, for all Sulphur (witneſs the <hi>Oleum Sulphuris per Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi>) has an occult Acid: And as <hi>Mercury</hi> has an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal <hi>Sulphur,</hi> (containing in it an occult venomous Acid) ſo by vertue of that <hi>Sulphur</hi> it is precipitaed <hi>per ſe</hi> (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore declared) by the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a gentle and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant fire.</p>
                     <pb n="525" facs="tcp:57532:274"/>
                     <p n="14">§ 14. For this reaſon it is that <hi>Tachenus</hi> would have <hi>Mercury</hi> regenerated out of <hi>Silver,</hi> or other <hi>perfect Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,</hi> that it may be freed from its external and poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous <hi>Sulphur;</hi> then, ſays he, wanting that <hi>Sulphur,</hi> as it can never be precipiated <hi>per ſe,</hi> though decocted a whole year in the abovena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med flat-bottom'd Veſſel, with a proper Fire, yet will it move Sweat, and ſweetly perform its Operations, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Experience confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming as much.</p>
                     <p n="15">§ 15. And being thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in its eſſential parts, (<hi>viz.</hi> freed from its poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous <hi>Sulphur</hi>) it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conjoyn'd with new and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>then it will become the ſubject of all Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> And if it be ſublimed with <hi>Sulphur</hi> to rubifie it, (as in the Preparation of <hi>Cinnabar</hi>) yet will it gain little or nothing in weight: which is an Obſervation worth the conſidering.</p>
                     <p n="16">§ 16. It remains only that we ſhew you <hi>Charras</hi>'s way of performing the Operation of the vulgar Precipitate <hi>per ſe,</hi> and ſo conclude this Section. <hi>Get an</hi> Infernus, <hi>which is a Veſſel of double Glaſs, the neck whereof muſt be long and very much like a Funnel, and the bottom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of large and very broad; put into it Mercury revived from Cinnabar</hi> ℥<hi>iv. ſet it in a Lamp-Fornace, in a ſand-heat,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then having filled a Lamp with Oyl, and lighted three Cotton Wicks of a fit bigneſs, and put them under the Sand Veſſel; ſo order it that they may burn without ceaſing, and that the Oyl may not fail for fifteen days, at the end whereof make every Wick a third part bigger, and keep them lighted for fifteen other days: After thirty days make every Wick bigger by one half, burning as before for another month, or till the Q. S. becomes a red and ſhining pouder.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="17">§ 17. Where note, that it is enough all the time to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the top of the Veſſel with a ſingle Paper, and to take care that the Oyl be not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Lamps, but that all the Wicks may burn equally, and continually caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Flame at an equal diſtance, to the bottom of the Sand-veſſel: This work is tedious, but that trouble not great, if you have a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and Fornace proper, and that the Veſſel be ſet in an equal poiſe.</p>

This ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the Uſe of the Balſam and Tincture of Sulphur, and is to be eſteemed by reaſon of its Efficacy and Vertue: for as Sulphur is of it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, and preſerves dead Bodies, from Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction; ſo alſo it hinders the Corruption and Decay of living Bodies, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtores the Defects of the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Balſam of Life, when once it is altered.</p>
                     <p>§2. Wherefore we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to all, the Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Sulphur, becauſe it ſupplies with Medicaments,

Some calcine the Sale of Tartar with <hi>Sulphur,</hi> to hinder it from diſſolving ſo eaſily by the Air, or to preſerve it in its beauty and dryneſs; Thus. <hi>They mix three Ounces of the Salt with one Ounce of Sulphur in Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, cauſing it to burn and conſume over a good Charcole fire, then elixiviate, filter, and evaporate the Humidity to a Pellicle, in a Glaſs Cucur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit over a Sand-heat, and ſet it to cryſtallize, ſeparating the Cryſtals,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

The aptneſs of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calious Salts</hi> to diſſolve in the Air, is natural to them, not can it be taken from them, but by deſtroying their Nature; for having had in their Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation as much of the Acid as was requiſite for their fixa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but not to fill up all the Cavities or Pores which the force and violence of the Fire had left there, they have their Pores open, and ſubject to any penetration, eſpecially that of the Air, when expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to it: But when they meet with an Acid more powerful, ſuch as that ariſing from the Sulphur, mixt and calcin'd with them in their laſt Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation they fill themſelves ſo much, that having no more vacuities, the Acid of the Air cannot break the ſtrict Union which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and ſo preſerves the Salt from ſuch a facile diſſolution.</p>
                     <p n="16">§ 16.

                     <p n="19">§ 19. But I think it not the beſt way for to expoſe this, or any other Vegetable alcalious Salt to ſuch vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and frequent Calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for it cannot be done without a notable Diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome of their beſt parts, and among the reſt, of the ſpirituous Sulphur: as is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable in the diſſipation of the Scent and Savour of the Plant, which happens al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to Salts thus calcin'd, which otherwiſe were they not ſo expoſed to the violence of the Fire, would preſerve a good part of them.</p>

In our <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron Medicum, Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 10. <hi>Sect.</hi> 20. we have given you five other ſeveral ways of preparing this Volatile Salt of Tartar; the fourth of which is <hi>Lemery's</hi> Method, ſo that referring you thither, we need ſay no more of it here, only make ſome ſhort Obſervations concerning the ſame.</p>
                     <p n="2">§ 2. It is my Opinion (from an Experiment which I accidentally made) that Salt of Tartar is naturally Volatile, and ſo that no great Study or Labor need be uſed to change its Nature; and Volatile it will be, if you hinder the Acid of the Tartar from fixing it, or otherwiſe ſeparate them when united and fixed together.</p>
                     <p n="3">§ 3. The Ancients and many of the Moderns in ſearching after this volatile Salt, generally met with ill ſucceſs, or wholly miſt their end, becauſe they underſtood not the aptneſs which vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and fixt Salts have to joyn with Acids; nor the indiſſolubility of their union when joyned together, and therefore they determined that (becauſe they underſtood not the way) there was no ſuch thing in nature.</p>
                     <p n="4">§ 4. And tho' the Acid and Volatile Salts, naturally found in Tartar, are not to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated but with much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and are always inclin'd to unite themſelves as ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together as is poſſible, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in Calcination which (diſſipates the Watery parts, which ſenſibly kept them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and) manifeſtly cloſes up the Earthy parts, ſerving as a means to their Union, leaving a ſufficiency of the
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:57532:355"/>Acid to maintain that Union (notwithſtanding the large diminution of the Acid in that Operation;) yet this ſeeming invincible Difficulty, this Gordian-knot, this almoſt indiſſoluble Unity, Nature it ſelf has lead us by the hand to ſurmount and overcome.</p>
                     <p n="5">§ 5. For ſince it is the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid which fixes the Volatile part, and keeps it in its Chains, if you would brake its Bands, and deliver the Priſoner, you muſt ſurmount that Acid, by the addition of ſome new Acid, which may unite it ſelf with that fixt Salt.</p>
                     <p n="6">§ 6. For the Salt of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar having loſt in Calcination much of the Acid parts which ſtopt it, and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only ſo much left to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the quality of the fixt: the moſt fixed part of this Salt, being hungry, and as it were, half ſtarv'd for want of Acid enough, it comes to paſs, that ſwiftly uniting it ſelf to this new Acid, whoſe Particles are ready to fill all the Vacancies which the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and action of the Fire had made empty, by this U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion it relinquiſhes the Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile parts, and they reſume their natural Liberty and Volatility, which is evident by its Smell, and all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſigns, eſſential to Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Salts.</p>
                     <p n="7">§ 7. And this is clear in the Volatile Salts of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, which have been fixed by Acids, where we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to <hi>fixed Salts,</hi> which are only able to force the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid Salts to abandon the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile, to unite themſelves to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereby, the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile being diſengaged it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears with all the Qualities and Diſpoſitions proper to it.</p>

                     <p n="9">§ 9. But this Salt of <hi>Lees,</hi> ſeems to be all Acid, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that they abound in an Alcalious volatile Salt and a ſulphurous Spirit, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but a very little Acid.</p>
                     <p n="10">§ 10. To which we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That if ſo, it muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the more the <hi>Lees</hi> ferment, the more they muſt loſe of their Acidity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe the Alcaly would abſorb or deſtroy it; the contrary of which we every day ſee, for they by ſo much, glow the
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:57532:356"/>more ſowre; as the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-makers can experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally tell you, who uſe <hi>Lees</hi> to make them ferment with that Wine, which they would ſpeedily turn to Vinegar: and this <hi>Tartar</hi> does all diſſolve in the Wine, and turns into Vinegar, for very little or no <hi>Lees,</hi> or other <hi>Tartar</hi> is to be found in thoſe Veſſels in which the Vinegar is made, tho' there was ſome naturally before, or other Tartar had been added to it.</p>
                     <p n="11">§ 11. Out of what has been ſaid, it plainly appears, that the Volatile Salt in the <hi>Lees,</hi> is a Volatile Acid, and is the ſame, that makes the Acid Spirit of Vinegar, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more volatile than many other Acids) to volatilize with its Flegm in the diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                     <p n="12">§ 12. But the Salt of Tartar drawn by Retort (after <hi>Lemery</hi>'s Method) does riſe more eaſily, than the Spirit of Vinegar, which comes to paſs from its being volatiliz'd by the violent heat of the Fire.</p>
                     <p n="13">§ 13. Againſt what has been ſaid, ſome may object, that <hi>Lees</hi> are ſometimes add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Wines grown ropy, to make them good again, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſowering them in the leaſt, or making them grow hard: which is true, becauſe the firſt Fermentation was imperfect, as appears by the ropineſs of the Liquor; for had it been ſufficiently fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, it would never have grown ropy: this ropyneſs or gummyneſs, contains ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly a great quantity of Oil (which by Retort may be drawn from it:) The Salt of the <hi>Lees</hi> then, conjoyning with thoſe Oily Particles of the Liquor, does rarifie and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt them into that Subſtance of which Spirit of Wine is made; and ſo long as the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> Particles of the <hi>Lees,</hi> ſhall find <hi>Oily</hi> Particles to act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Wine will not grow ſowre, but refine, and grow better: but being added, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a perfect Fermentation, wherein thoſe Oily Particles are all diſſolved, it changes the Liquor into a ſowerneſs, and makes it become Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, as at § 10. aforegoing is proved.</p>
                     <p n="14">§ 14. This Salt is ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in a Bolt-head, that the Flegm which is too heavy to riſe eaſily ſo high may not mix with it: but it is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to keep this Salt dry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it eaſily grows moiſt and diſſolves into a Liquor; for which reaſon it is much better to draw it in a Spirit, for thereby leſs of the Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:57532:356"/>parts would be loſt being detained by the Flegm.</p>
                     <p n="15">§ 15. The reaſon of its aptneſs to diſſolve and melt <hi>per Deliquium,</hi> proceeds from the more Eſſential parts being volatiliz'd, there remaining much of the fixt Acid Salt in the Earth or Feces.</p>
                     <p n="16">§ 16. From whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that tho' in the <hi>Lees</hi> it was a <hi>Volatile Acid Salt,</hi> (as we ſaid at § 11. above:) Yet after diſtillation in a Retort, it becomes an <hi>Alcali</hi> by the means of the Fire, as other Volatile Salts do; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no probability that it could be of this nature ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the <hi>Plant</hi> or in the <hi>Lees</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="17">§ 17. But if you had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have the Salt in a dry Form, than in a ſpirit or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid Form, <hi>mix the Spirit or Liquor with a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Bone-Aſhes finely pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and make thereof a Paſte, which make into little Balls or Pellets, put them into a Bolt-head, and fit to it a blind Head, ſo will the Salt ſublime very pure, white, and dry, which keep in Glaſſes cloſe ſtopt for uſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="18">§ 18. Out of the Feces left in the Retort (being after calcin'd in an open Fire) you may extract a <hi>fixt Alcalious Salt,</hi> as out of common cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin'd Tartar, but it will be in a vaſtly leſs quantity, from whence it appears, that the greateſt part of the Salt of the <hi>Lees</hi> is truly volatiliz'd, which is the thing propoſed to be done.</p>

A Bolt-head, or a long Body with its Head, may ſerve for this Operation, becauſe the Flegm being too heavy cannot aſcend ſo high and therefore the <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> in its flight, leaves it, and ſublimes alone, which is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be rectified and made more pure.</p>
